# 👋 Hey, I'm Joel Lueders

## 🕵️‍♂️ Red Team Curious | 🛠️ Security Tinkerer | 🎭 UX-Driven Chaos Engineer

---

**Current Mission:**  
Leaning full-tilt into the world of cybersecurity with a focus on red teaming, prompt injection, jailbreak testing, and human-centered exploits. I'm especially interested in how social engineering, creative misdirection, and AI jailbreaking intersect with traditional pen testing.

---

### 🧠 Background Snapshot:

- Former surgical inventory specialist in a high-pressure pediatric hospital, where I learned how one broken link can halt an entire system. Sound familiar?
- Honed my UX design skills in the wild—leading warehouse transformations, designing for haunted houses, and teaching seniors how to use VR (yes, really).
- Army National Guard vet who understands that sometimes the mission is logistics, and sometimes it's infiltration.

---

### 🔍 What I'm Working On:

- **Studying Penetration Testing:** Learning Linux (Mint + Debian), Metasploit, Burp Suite, and the art of the subtle misstep.
- **AI Jailbreaks & Prompt Injection:** Building adversarial prompts to test the guardrails of LLMs and explore how systems break when you whisper just the right wrong thing.
- **Knowledge Garden:** Organizing a living library of attack types, vectors, and social engineering patterns—because real-world hacks don’t fit into neat categories.

---

### 🛠️ Skills I'm Building:

- Penetration Testing Basics (Kali, Recon, Exploitation)
- Prompt Engineering & Jailbreak Red Teaming
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals (networking, cryptography, threat modeling)
- Scripting (Python, Bash) – beginner level but increasing daily
- Documentation & Communication – a strength I bring from my UX/design background

---

### 🌱 What Sets Me Apart:

- **Creative Lens:** I come from the world of theater, haunted houses, and design thinking. I look for patterns, cracks, and overlooked systems—especially where humans meet machines.
- **Empathy-First Recon:** I don’t just think about how to break a system—I think about how someone might *feel* when it breaks. Red teaming isn’t just technical, it’s psychological.
- **Chaotic Good Alignment:** I like to explore ethically disruptive ways to make things better. Sometimes that means asking strange questions. Sometimes it means getting weird with it.
