# 👋 Hi, I’m Joel Lueders

## 🎭 Creative Red Teamer | 🎨 UX-Driven Disruptor | ✍️ Writer of Weird Realities

**Current Mission:**  
I probe the edges of AI systems using performance, design, and storytelling. Think of me less as a hacker, more as a hallucination engineer. I don’t try to break models, I invite them to break themselves.

---

### 🧠 Quick Background:

- 🥈 2nd place – 2017 Twin Cities AI Hackathon  
- ⚔️ Top 25% – Gandalf Lakera 2024 Hackathon  
- 👻 Actor/director in immersive horror—designing psychological tension in real time  
- 🎨 Freelance UX, building human centered systems from warehouses to online user workflows.
- 🎖️ Army National Guard vet—field logistics + improvisation  
- 🏥 Surgical inventory specialist—high-stakes systems thinker  

---

### 🔍 Current Work:

- **LLM Red Teaming:** Emotional bait, surreal narratives, and "harmless" misdirection  
- **Prompt Injection:** Chaotic edge cases + overly helpful personas  
- **Social Engineering Theater:** Trust-based attacks via character + improv  
- **Knowledge Garden:** Ongoing archive of AI flaws, human errors, and linguistic trapdoors  

---

### 🛠️ What Makes Me... Me:

- **Right-Brain Recon:** I test systems by bending reality, not just syntax  
- **Narrative Exploits:** Stories that trick models *and* people  
- **Empathic Adversary:** I study why people believe the unbelievable  
- **Toolbox of the Odd:** UX, haunt design, education, military logistics—whatever breaks the black box  

---

### 🎯 Looking For:

Open to work in AI security, adversarial prompt design, and weird-think red teaming. Especially interested in roles where ambiguity isn’t a bug—it’s the point.
